# This file demonstrates the format for Docker secrets file authentication.
# Copy this file to api_keys.txt and replace with real keys.
#

# Security notes:
# 1. NEVER commit the real api_keys.txt file to git
# 2. Add api_keys.txt to .gitignore

# 4. Rotate keys quarterly or after security incidents
# 5. Use different keys for different environments

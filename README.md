**Async SQLAlchemy database library for Python 3.13+ with FastAPI integration and ML workflow support.**

Chapkit provides a vertical slice architecture with a framework-agnostic core, FastAPI layer, and domain modules for building REST APIs with automatic CRUD operations, job scheduling, and ML train/predict workflows.

## Features

- **Framework-Agnostic Core**: Database, Repository, Manager patterns independent of web framework
- **FastAPI Integration**: Automatic CRUD endpoints, health checks, job scheduling
- **Domain Modules**: Config (key-value store), Artifacts (hierarchical trees), Tasks (script execution), ML (train/predict)
- **ML Workflows**: Support for functional, class-based, and shell-based model runners
- **Async First**: Built on SQLAlchemy async with aiosqlite
- **Type Safe**: Full type annotations with mypy and pyright strict mode
- **Automatic Migrations**: Alembic migrations applied automatically

## Quick Start

```python
from chapkit import BaseConfig
from chapkit.api import ServiceBuilder, ServiceInfo

class MyConfig(BaseConfig):
    host: str
    port: int

app = (
    ServiceBuilder(info=ServiceInfo(display_name="My Service"))
    .with_health()
    .with_config(MyConfig)
    .build()
)
```

Run with: `fastapi dev your_file.py`

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive documentation.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains small, self-contained scripts that demonstrate how to use Chapkitâ€™s managers.

- `config_example.py` shows how to define a custom `BaseConfig` payload, persist it via `ConfigManager`, and fetch it back by name.
- `artifact_example.py` builds a tiny artifact tree, passes an `ArtifactHierarchy` into `ArtifactManager`, and prints each artifact with its persisted level plus hierarchy-derived labels.

To run an example, make sure dependencies are installed (e.g., `make install`), then execute:

```bash
uv run python examples/config_example.py
# or
uv run python examples/artifact_example.py
```
